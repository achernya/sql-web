  Overview
</h2>
<p>
  The sql.mit.edu project believes that user privacy is of the utmost
  importance. However, there are some cases in which them maintainers
  of the sql.mit.edu project may access user data, including but not
  limited to: ensuring service stability and availability, and
  answering user support requests.

  Detailed policy

<p>
  THIS SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY THE SQL.MIT.EDU PROJECT AND
  CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

  DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SQL.MIT.EDU PROJECT OR

</p>
<p>
  The following policy covers the collection, retention and access of
  the private user information by sql.mit.edu service. For the purpose
  of this document, the term "user" refers to the users of the service
  itself, and not any other services which rely on sql.mit.edu to
  store the data.
</p>
<p>
  The majority of the private information collected and stored by the
  service falls into the following two categories:
  <ol>
    <li>Technical information which appears as a result of the
     service&rsquo;s operations, including, but not limited to,
     information about incoming connections, user and database
     metadata and system logs.</li>
    <li>Data in the user databases.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Privacy of both kinds of data is respected by sql.mit.edu
  project. Nobody except the user whose data is stored and the
  maintainers shall have immediate access to the private data. The
  access to that data by the maintainers of this service and its
  disclosure is regulated by this policy.
</p>
<p>
  Under normal circumstances, the maintainers are not allowed to
  access the user data or to disclose the user information to the
  third parties. However, in the following cases access or
  disclosure <em>may</em> be performed:
  <ol>
    <li>in order to investigate potential abuse of the service;</li>
    <li>in response to a legitimate request of law enforcement or a
    subpoena;</li>
    <li>if it is required for investigation by MIT IS&amp;T, Committee
     on Discipline or any other official bodies of MIT Faculty or
     Administration;</li>
    <li>if such information is required by MIT IS&amp;T in order to
     deal with technical issues or provide information to handle
     support requests;</li>
    <li>when the user in question gives explicit permission for such
    access/disclosure;</li>
    <li>when it is necessary to fulfill the support request from the
    user;</li>
    <li>if it is required to carry out technical maintenance of the
    service;</li>
    <li>if it is required in order to protect the safety of SIPB,
     members of MIT community or general public.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  In cases when such access or disclosure is performed (and especially
  in cases #1, #2, #3 and #8), the user may be notified; however, the
  service maintainers make no such obligation to do so in every single
  case, and in some cases such a notification may not be possible.
</p>
<p>
  Besides being stored on the service&rsquo;s own servers, the backup
  copies of user databases are stored on MIT AFS servers. While the
  permissions on those copies are set up so only users whose data is
  backed up and the service maintainers are able to access them, they
  are also accessible by some MIT IS&amp;T employees who have
  administrator access to the Athena AFS cell; their access to user
  data is not covered by this policy.
</p>
<p>
  Aggregate technical information is retained indefinitely, for
  service health monitoring and analytics. User-specific technical
  information is retained for a period of up to thirty (30) days. The
  user data is retained persistently, unless the user removes it
  themselves. Note that even after the user changes or removes the
  information, it is retained both in the backups generated by the
  service itself and the snapshots of AFS volume provided by IS&amp;T.
