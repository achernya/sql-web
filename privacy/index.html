However, there are some cases in which the maintainers of the sql.mit.edu project may access user data, including but not limited to: ensuring service stability and availability, and answering user support requests. </p> <h2> Detailed policy </h2> <p> THIS SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY THE SQL.MIT.EDU PROJECT AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SQL.MIT.EDU PROJECT OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. </p> <p> The following policy covers the collection, retention and access of the private user information by sql.mit.edu service. For the purpose of this document, the term "user" refers to the users of the service itself, and not any other services which rely on sql.mit.edu to store the data. </p> <p> The majority of the private information collected and stored by the service falls into the following two categories: <ol> <li>Technical information which appears as a result of the service&rsquo;s operations, including, but not limited to, information about incoming connections, user and database metadata and system logs.</li> <li>Data in the user databases.</li> </ol> </p> <p> Privacy of both kinds of data is respected by sql.mit.edu project. Nobody except the user whose data is stored and the maintainers shall have immediate access to the private data. The access to that data by the maintainers of this service and its disclosure is regulated by this policy. </p> <p> Under normal circumstances, the maintainers are not allowed to access the user data or to disclose the user information to the third parties. However, in the following cases access or disclosure <em>may</em> be performed: <ol> <li>in order to investigate potential abuse of the service;</li> <li>in response to a legitimate request of law enforcement or a subpoena;</li> <li>if it is required for investigation by MIT IS&amp;T, Committee on Discipline or any other official bodies of MIT Faculty or Administration;</li> <li>if such information is required by MIT IS&amp;T in order to deal with technical issues or provide information to handle support requests;</li> <li>when the user in question gives explicit permission for such access/disclosure;</li> <li>when it is necessary to fulfill the support request from the user;</li> <li>if it is required to carry out technical maintenance of the service;</li> <li>if it is required in order to protect the safety of SIPB, members of MIT community or general public.</li> </ol> </p> <p> In cases when such access or disclosure is performed (and especially in cases #1, #2, #3 and #8), the user may be notified; however, the service maintainers make no such obligation to do so in every single case, and in some cases such a notification may not be possible. </p> <p> Besides being stored on the service&rsquo;s own servers, the backup copies of user databases are stored on MIT AFS servers. While the permissions on those copies are set up so only users whose data is backed up and the service maintainers are able to access them, they are also accessible by some MIT IS&amp;T employees who have administrator access to the Athena AFS cell; their access to user data is not covered by this policy. </p> <p> Aggregate technical information is retained indefinitely, for service health monitoring and analytics. User-specific technical information is retained for a period of up to thirty (30) days. The user data is retained persistently, unless the user removes it themselves. Note that even after the user changes or removes the information, it is retained both in the backups generated by the service itself and the snapshots of AFS volume provided by IS&amp;T. </p> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="navbar navbar-fixed-bottom footer"> <div class="container"> <footer> <p class="pull-right"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p> <p>Copyright &copy; 2013 <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu/">MIT SIPB</a> &middot; <a href="/privacy/">Privacy</a> &middot; <a href="http://ist.mit.edu/athena/olh/rules">Rules of Use</a></p> </footer> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal hide fade" id="sql-modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="sql-modal-label" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-body"> </div> </div> <div class="alert" id="alert-template" hidden> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button> <strong class="alert-template-head">Alert</strong> <span class="alert-template-body"></span> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/sockjs.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/q.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/sjcl.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/winchan.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/webathena.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/gss.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena/remctl.js"></script> <script src="/assets/webathena-sql/core.js"></script> </body> </html>
