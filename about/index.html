  Nightly backups
</h2>
<p>
  Around 4 AM each day, two backups are performed: a monolithic backup
  to restore the entire server in the event of a catastrophe, and an
  individual backup for each user. At least 3 of the most recent
  monolithic backups are kept at all times, in addition to some
  historical backups that are encrypted and stored on separate
  servers. The nightly, individual backups are available at
  <code>/mit/sql/backup/</code>. The previous day&rsquo;s backup is also
  available upon request.

  Software stack
</h2>
<p>
  sql.mit.edu currently runs the community edition of
  MySQL. We&rsquo;ll be upgrading to MariaDB, the newest version of
  the community-supported MySQL, when the servers are upgraded
  from <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> 6.0 (squeeze) to
  Debian 7.0 (wheezy). The servers run the latest version
  of <a href="http://debathena.mit.edu/">Debathena</a> to integrate
  with the MIT Athena computing environment.
</p>
<p>
  All of the source code powering sql.mit.edu is open source under the
  FIXME license. This includes
  the <a href="https://github.com/achernya/sql-web">web
  interface</a>, <a href="https://github.com/achernya/sql-backup">backup
  scripts</a>, and
  the <a href="https://github.com/achernya/sql-remctl">remote control
  interface</a>. The server-side code is written almost entirely
  in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. The web interface is
  written in HTML and Javascript.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike most web applications at MIT, you can&rsquo;t log into
  sql.mit.edu with a certificate. Instead, we
  use <a href="https://webathena.mit.edu/">Webathena</a>, a web-based
  implementation
  of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/">Kerberos</a>. Our servers
  never learn your password. In fact, your password never leaves your
  browser. Since the password isn&rsquo;t sent to the server,
  there&rsquo;s no session to log in and out of&mdash;it&rsquo;s all
  in your browser.

  Server specifications
</h2>
<p>
  sql.mit.edu has two identical servers,
  named <code>primary-key</code> and <code>foreign-key</code>. Both of
  these servers have
  <ul>
    <li>2x Intel Xeon E5430 (4x2.66GHz) CPUs</li>
    <li>32GB DDR2-667 ECC RAM</li>
    <li>2x2TB SATA Hard Drives in RAID1 (mirroring)</li>
    <li>2x512GB SSDs in RAID1 (mirroring)</li>
  </ul>

  Access and limitations
</h2>
<p>
  Unlike most database providers, sql.mit.edu doesn&rsquo;t have any
  restrictions on what client is used. However, since sql.mit.edu is
  available to the entire MIT community, there is currently a 100
  megabyte quota for all accounts. If you exceed this quota,
  you&rsquo;ll be unable to make more databases, and the nightly
  backup will skip your account for the individual
  backups. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to request a quota
  increase.
