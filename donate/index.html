<h2>
  sql.mit.edu is a volunteer-run service
</h2>
<p>
  Like all other <a href="http://sipb.mit.edu">SIPB</a> services, we
  provide sql.mit.edu because we think it's a useful service for the
  MIT community. Like other student groups, SIPB has an annual budget,
  but it's not enough for us to do all of the improvements we have
  planned. Your donation will help improve not just sql.mit.edu, but
  also the other SIPB services, as well as help us start new,
  interesting and useful services for the MIT community.

<h2>
